Since last post I started study software engineering. When I started studying, starting with requirements engineering, I remembered why studying software engineering was so bad.

It seems that they are more concerned with "how it should be done" than with "what should be done". It makes it seem that the main objective is to create and describe processes, define modeling and generate documents, for me the most important thing will always be what should be done. But then I read some things and started writing a document to specify my software, what should be done, the scope of the project. When I started writing I realized the first need, how to explain and describe the problem I intend to solve, so now I am studying and making some basic definitions, I feel that if I define well what verse, rhymes, beat, that kind of thing, it will be more easy to model the bank.

many people continue to die, this is sad. Maybe I'll start publishing here too, fanfic's about the whereabouts of a friend of mine.
