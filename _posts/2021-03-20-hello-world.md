Hello World, this is my first blog post and I think it would be nice if I introduced myself. Hello, I'm King Ghidorah, a giant three-headed dragon Kaiju coming directly from the city of the mystic bird, in state of Goi√°s in Brazil. I recently graduade in computer science and now I am working as a Web Developer.

### The idea behind the blog

Yesterday, technically this morning arround 2 am, while I was high, sad, feeling alone living in post-apocalyptic future that instead of having gangs of bikers addicted to drugs, what you have are people who say against science and favor it, I had an Idea.

I will build software, I fucking studied it in college, the theory is clear, so I want to do the pratice now. I intend to read and study greats classics in the Software Engineering literature and go through all the stages of building software, from requirements to maintenance. I instend to use technologies that I have never worked with, besides having several processes that I still don't know how to host servers, devops, these things. So during the processes before building the software, I wil be studying some new technologies.

The blog will have much more of a character to describe my daily life than reporting how to build software. I feel it would be good to get thigs out of me, in addition to being able to train my English.

In the next post I wil go describe my software idea, and over time i will update the About.
