Rhimes, is about this. I really like rhymes, how people can write verses with great rhymes and with advanced techniques.  I intend to build a platform for people to build and analyze rhymes rhymes schemes. Roughly speaking it can be said that will be a [genius](https://genius.com/), but instead of focusing on the meaning of the verses, it will be focused n rhymes.

For those who still do not understand, see how is an analysis of rhymes [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ROEZGEnKJo).

I imagine that in the future I will do this description better, but now, I will state some features that I imagine that will have in the first version and some future ideas.

### MVC

* User registration and CRUD
* Analyze letters that will be provided by a service and analyze letters that users will write.
* In analyze user can paint the syllables that rhyme, and creation observation, and description of rhyme scheme.
* User can share your analysis
* Export analysis as image or html

### Future Features
* create a way for users to do analyzes collaboratively
* generate statistcs
* analyse of flow, beat
* make more social the app

These definitions are preliminary in the future will have a document with formal definitions.

The next step I will take is to study the first stages of the software project and start to define the tasks and processes. I will use Kanban
